# About
Hello! üëã I'm Raghav, a Masters of Business Analytics candidate at MIT, graduating in August 2024. Currently a Graduate Research Assistant at MIT, collaborating with Massachusetts General Hospital on machine learning for automating and improving kidney transplant patient donor matching decisions.

I graduated with Highest Honors in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech in May 2023. Previous experience includes research on machine learning in prostate cancer and internships at Abiomed and Flow MedTech.

Passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to enhance business decisions.

I'm proud to share that the starting at the age of 4, I learned mental arithmetic through SIP ABACUS. I completed all the levels, won an International Competition and 4 national competitions in India and was recognized with the priviledge of one of few students selected to Ms. Pratibha Patil, President of India. I was one of two students chosen at my high school to deliver a TED Talk about how ABACUS has helped my life and here is the talk with 26,000+ views [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EYWHe1yyjM):
