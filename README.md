# About
Hello! üëã I'm Raghav, a **Master of Business Analytics** candidate at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, graduating in August 2024. Currently a Graduate Research Assistant at MIT under the supervision of Professor Swati Gupta, I'm applying machine learning for automating and improving kidney transplant patient donor matching decisions. I graduated with Highest Honors in Biomedical Engineering from **Georgia Institute of Technology** in May 2023. Previous experience includes machine learning research as an Undergraduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor Ahmet Coskum in prostate cancer cell classification and internships at Abiomed (acquired by Johnson & Johnson) and Flow MedTech (now Cardio REST).<br>

I began learning **mental arithmetic** at age 4 through SIP ABACUS. I completed all 13 levels, won **1 International Competition**, and **4 national competitions** in India. I was **privileged to meet President of India** at the time, Ms. Pratibha Patil, as one of the few selected students. Also delivered a **TED Talk** at my high school, garnering **26,000+** Youtube views. Here is the video: [TEDx talk (What the abacus taught me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EYWHe1yyjM) <br>

I love working with data and numbers and I'm passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to enhance business decisions.<br>

[MIT Analytics Lab: Building CMA CGM's First AI-Powered Email Assistant](alab.md) <br>
**‚≠ê Won 3rd place at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy‚Äôs Analytics Lab Event <br>**
CMA CGM is the largest shipping company in the US and receives 100,000+ emails a week. Responding to these emails consumes a lot of time for the customer service agents. This project develops an AI-powered email assistant to classify emails into different categories and generate responses to emails identified as automatable. Project uses **NLP**, **LLMs**.

[Sherlock Picasso: Marketing Tool for Small Medium Businesses](https://github.com/maxime7770/Sherlock-Picasso/blob/main/README.md)<br>
**‚≠ê Won 2nd place at the MIT Google Product Hackathon**<br>
80% of small and medium-sized businesses struggle to draw in customers, particularly as 74% of consumers now make purchasing decisions online. While 47% of these businesses handle marketing independently, many lack the expertise and resources needed for effective campaigns. This tool aims to support these businesses by providing recommendations to enhance their social media presence. Users can submit an image and caption for a potential Instagram post, along with their competitors' Instagram user handles. This tool will give recommendations to improve the image and caption based on analyzing what their customers like and what has worked well for their competitors. Project uses **NLP**, **LLMs**.

[AI Earth Hackathon: Circular Economy Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/AI-Earth-Hackathon/blob/main/README.md)<br>
**‚≠ê Ranked Top 15% in the AI Earth Hackathon<br>**
[Demo](https://ai-earth-hackathon.streamlit.app/) <br>
In response to the proliferation of circular solutions, there's a pressing need to assess their efficacy. With numerous options available, determining the most effective ones is crucial for advancing sustainable practices. As circular economy initiatives gain momentum, the abundance of available solutions necessitates a reliable method to rank and prioritize them effectively. By evaluating metrics such as relevance to problem, impact, feasibility, and scalability, organizations can make informed decisions to drive meaningful environmental change. This tool leverages **NLP techniques**, **Zero Shot Classification**, and **Gemini Pro LLM** to evaluate circular economy solutions on the aforementionned metrics and more with each metric being scored between 1-3 and an average score being used to rank the solutions.

[Machine Learning Project: Multimodal Hate Speech Detection with Twitter Data (Images and Text)](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Multimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection/blob/main/ML_final_report.pdf) <br>
In today's social media landscape, platforms like X (formerly Twitter) serve as global hubs for expression. However, they grapple with the pervasive issue of hate speech, which targets individuals or groups based on identity factors. This poses significant threats to online safety and societal cohesion. Our project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine learning model adept at discerning between hateful and non-hateful tweets. Through a **multimodal approach** utilizing both textual and image data, this model detects hate speech on Twitter using **Convolutional Neural Networks** and **BERT Transformer Models**.

[Analytics Edge Project: Predicting Startup Success](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Predicting-Startup-Success/blob/main/Analytics%20Edge%20Project%20Report.pdf)<br>
With startup trajectories being so complicated and volatile, this project aims to build a predictive model using data analytics and machine learning. By analyzing factors like market trends, funding dynamics, and team composition from historical data, this project seeks to assess startup success potential. The model aims to provide valuable insights for both high-profile and low-profile investors, entrepreneurs, and accelerators, aiding them in making informed investment decisions in the volatile startup landscape using **Random Forest**, **XG Boost**, **Sparse Logistic Regression**, and **CART**.

[Optimization Project: Stock Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Stock-Portfolio-Optimization/blob/main/OPT%20Project%202023_Final%20Report_US%20Stock%20Portfolio%20Optimization%20(1).pdf)<br>
As novice investors, we were initially drawn to popular stocks, but quickly learned the complexities of the market. Pitfalls like emotional trading and market unpredictability became evident, prompting us to seek thoughtful investment strategies. Post-COVID-19, market volatility intensified, underscoring the need for careful navigation. Our project addresses these challenges by exploring portfolio optimization through **mixed-integer**, **multi-objective optimization**, aiming to design optimal portfolios for traders facing diverse constraints and scenarios.
