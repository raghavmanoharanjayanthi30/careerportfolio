[MIT Analytics Lab: Building CMA CGM's First AI-Powered Email Assistant](alab.md) <br>
**‚≠ê Won 3rd place at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy‚Äôs Analytics Lab Event <br>**
CMA CGM is the largest shipping company in the US and receives 100,000+ emails a week. Responding to these emails consumes a lot of time for the customer service agents. This project develops an AI-powered email assistant to classify emails into different categories and generate responses to emails identified as automatable. Project uses **NLP**, **LLMs**.

[Sherlock Picasso - Marketing Tools for Small Medium Businesses](https://github.com/maxime7770/Sherlock-Picasso/blob/main/README.md)<br>
**‚≠ê Won 2nd place at the MIT Google Product Hackathon**<br>
80% of small and medium-sized businesses struggle to draw in customers, particularly as 74% of consumers now make purchasing decisions online. While 47% of these businesses handle marketing independently, many lack the expertise and resources needed for effective campaigns. This marketing tool aims to aid small and medium-sized businesses by offering recommendations for enhancing their social media presence. Users can submit an image and caption for a potential Instagram post, along with their competitors' Instagram user handles. This tool will give recommendations to improve the image and caption based on analyzing whether their customers like and what has worked well for their competitors. Project uses **NLP**, **LLMs**.

[AI Earth Hackathon - Circular Economy Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/AI-Earth-Hackathon)<br>
**‚≠ê Ranked Top 15% in the AI Earth Hackathon<br>**
In response to the proliferation of circular solutions, there's a pressing need to assess their efficacy. With numerous options available, determining the most effective ones is crucial for advancing sustainable practices. As circular economy initiatives gain momentum, the abundance of available solutions necessitates a reliable method to rank and prioritize them effectively. By evaluating their impact, feasibility, and scalability, organizations can make informed decisions to drive meaningful environmental change. This tool leverages **NLP techniques**, **Zero Shot Classification**, and **Gemini Pro LLM** to evaluate circular economy scores on these metrics.<br>

[Machine Learning Project: Multimodal Hate Speech Detection with Twitter Data (Images and Text)](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Multimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection/blob/main/ML_final_report.pdf) <br>
In today's social media landscape, platforms like X (formerly Twitter) serve as global hubs for expression. However, they grapple with the pervasive issue of hate speech, which targets individuals or groups based on identity factors. This poses significant threats to online safety and societal cohesion. Our project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine learning model adept at discerning between hateful and non-hateful tweets. Through a multimodal approach utilizing both textual and image data, this model detects hate speech on Twitter using **Convolutional Neural Networks** and **BERT Transformer Models**.

[Predicting Startup Success](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Predicting-Startup-Success/blob/main/Analytics%20Edge%20Project%20Report.pdf)<br>
With startup trajectories being so complicated and volatile, this project aims to build a predictive model using data analytics and machine learning. By analyzing factors like market trends, funding dynamics, and team composition from historical data, this project seeks to assess startup success potential. The model aims to provide valuable insights for both high-profile and low-profile investors, entrepreneurs, and accelerators, aiding them in making informed investment decisions in the volatile startup landscape using **Random Forest**, **XG Boost**, **Sparse Logistic Regression**, and **CART**.

[Optimization Project: Stock Portfolio Optimization (see more)](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Stock-Portfolio-Optimization/blob/main/OPT%20Project%202023_Final%20Report_US%20Stock%20Portfolio%20Optimization%20(1).pdf)<br>
As novice investors in the stock market, we initially gravitated towards well-known companies and high-flying stocks. However, we soon realized the complexities involved. Common pitfalls such as lack of strategy, emotional trading, and market unpredictability became evident. This realization marked a turning point, emphasizing the need for thoughtful investment approaches. Post-COVID-19, the market's volatility became even more pronounced, necessitating careful navigation. Recognizing the importance of portfolio optimization, our project explores this art, employing optimization techniques to design optimal portfolios for traders facing these challenges under different constraints and scenarios using **mixed-integer**, **multi-objective optimization**.
