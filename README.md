# About
Hello! I'm Raghav, a **Master of Business Analytics** candidate at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**, graduating in Aug 2024. I'm currently a Graduate Research Assistant under Prof. Swati Gupta, applying machine learning to improve kidney transplant donor matching. Previously, I earned a Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering with Highest Honors from **Georgia Institute of Technology**. I've also conducted machine learning research on prostate cancer cells and completed internships at Abiomed (now acquired by Johnson & Johnson) and Flow MedTech (now Cardio REST). 

I excelled in **mental arithmetic** from age 4, mastering all 13 levels of SIP ABACUS and winning 1 international and 4 national competitions in India. I had the honor of meeting President of the India at the time, Pratibha Patil. Additionally, I was 1 of 2 students selected from my high school to speak at both a **TEDx event** and the **Middle East Youth Forum**, with my TEDx talk receiving over 26,000 views. Watch my TEDx talk [TEDx talk (What the abacus taught me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EYWHe1yyjM) <br>

I love working with data and numbers and I'm passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to enhance business decisions.<br>

![Profile Picture](pictures/Sherlock_Picasso.jpg) <br>
80% of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) struggle with customer acquisition, especially with 74% of consumers buying online. While 47% handle marketing themselves, lacking expertise and resources hinders success. This tool aids SMBs by enhancing social media presence. Users submit an image, caption, and competitors' Instagram handles. Recommendations improve content based on customer preferences and competitor success. Project utilizes **NLP**, **LLMs**.

[Machine Learning Project: Multimodal Hate Speech Detection with Twitter Data (Images and Text)](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Multimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection/blob/main/ML_final_report.pdf) <br>
![Profile Picture](pictures/hate_speech.jpg) <br>
In today's social media landscape, platforms like X (formerly Twitter) serve as global hubs for expression. However, they grapple with the pervasive issue of hate speech, which targets individuals or groups based on identity factors. This poses significant threats to online safety and societal cohesion. This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine learning model adept at discerning between hateful and non-hateful tweets. Through a **multimodal approach** utilizing both textual and image data, this model detects hate speech on Twitter using **Convolutional Neural Networks** and **BERT Transformer Models**.

[Analytics Edge Project: Predicting Startup Success](https://github.com/raghavmanoharanjayanthi30/Predicting-Startup-Success/blob/main/Analytics%20Edge%20Project%20Report.pdf)<br>
![Profile Picture](pictures/StartUpSuccess.jpg) <br>
With startup trajectories being so complicated and volatile, this project aims to build a predictive model using data analytics and machine learning. By analyzing factors like market trends, funding dynamics, and team composition from historical data, this project seeks to assess startup success potential. The model aims to provide valuable insights for both high-profile and low-profile investors, entrepreneurs, and accelerators, aiding them in making informed investment decisions in the volatile startup landscape using **Random Forest**, **XG Boost**, **Sparse Logistic Regression**, and **CART** achieving 75% out of sample accuracy.
