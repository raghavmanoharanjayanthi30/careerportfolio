# About

Hello there! üëã I‚Äôm Raghav, a Masters of Business Analytics candidate at MIT graduating in August 2024. I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor Swati Gupta in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, applying machine learning in kidney transplant allocation for automation and improving patient donor matching process.

I graduated with Highest Honors with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2023. I worked as a research assistant in 2021 under the supervision of Professor Ahmet Coskun applying machine learning in prostate cancer cell image classification. I also did a couple of internships at Abiomed and Flow MedTech as a Product Development Co-op and Engineering Intern respectively.

I am an aspiring data scientist passionate about applying machine learning to improve business decisions.
